Technical Literature

- **Bishop, 2006: Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning** https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2006/01/Bishop-Pattern-Recognition-and-Machine-Learning-2006.pdf
  - I think that this resource should be mandatory to grasp for anyone who wants a "ML" substring inside his job title. Classic ML lays many foundations for the current ML landscape and I encounter more and more Data Scientists these days that do not have the privilege of having a profound basic knowledge on ML, but only follow the latest trends from a very high altitude.
- **Goodfellow et al, 2016: Deep Learning** https://www.deeplearningbook.org/
  - A classic from my time at the university. Reading it nowadays feels nostalgic: the later chapters mention GANs, Autoencoders and other architectures since these were the coolest thing since sliced bread at the time of writing.
- **Barto and Sutton: 2019: Reinforcement Learning: an Introduction** https://web.stanford.edu/class/psych209/Readings/SuttonBartoIPRLBook2ndEd.pdf
  - The authors just got awarded the ACM 2024 Turing Award. Their book is a strong resource if you want to get into Reinforcement Learning.
- **McElreath: Statistical Rethinking (Second Edition)** https://civil.colorado.edu/~balajir/CVEN6833/bayes-resources/RM-StatRethink-Bayes.pdf
  - I have never read a book with such a convincing narrative. Every chapter contains some real world problems and the reader learns a lot of background information about many different disciplines (epistemology, philosophy, science,...)
- **Kimball: The Data Warehouse Toolkit - The definitive guide to dimensional modeling**
  - Many engaging realistic scenarios that are used to illustrate the concepts of the individual chapters.
- Some O'Reilly Picks:
  - **Kubeflow for Machine Learning - From Lab to Production**
  - **Data Algorithms with Spark**

Other Literature

- **Josh Waitzkin: The Art of Learning**
- **Daniel Kahneman: Thinking, Fast and Slow**
- **Philippa Perry: The Book You Wish Your Parents Had ReadÂ (and Your Children Will Be Glad That You Did)**
