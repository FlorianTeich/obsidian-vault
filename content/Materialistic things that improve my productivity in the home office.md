When it comes to monitors, I have the same attitude as when it comes to cutting boards in the kitchen: the bigger, the better. Sure, a smaller device will do the job, but I can save so much time by __not__ switching context as only one or two windows fit on my display at the same time and i need to glance at all of them at once. My monitor is the C49RG9x with 120 Hz and 5120 x 1440 pixel resolution.

I just switched from my beloved Keychron K8 Mechanical Keyboard to my first ergonomic keyboard: the Kinesis Advantage360 Pro. I really love that there is a community of ergo keyboard enthusiast online that develop and publish blueprints for their custom keyboards. However, I am too anxious to build one on my own - too much could go wrong and suddenly you find yourself waiting for a single replacement-piece of hardware that takes months to ship. That said, I really like this keyboard. It is the first keyboard at which I consistently make use of my ten finger typing skills. Prior to this keyboard, I never felt the urge to type this way. I like the idea of relieving the little fingers and instead let the thumbs do more work. No matter which OS I am using (Linux, Mac, Windows), the keyboard connects seamlessly via bluetooth, way less friction than with my Keychron (long pairing procedure).

## Desk - IKEA Bekant

This one is a big enabler, as I can easily switch from sitting to standing regularly during work. Sadly, my BEKANT model is not sold anymore by IKEA. One Problem I have with this table is that they cheaped out on the power supply: no grounding/protective contact.

## Mice - Logitech MX Vertical and Logitech Lift

Logitech MX Vertical (Right) and Logitech Lift (Left). Yes, I got two - one for the right hand and one for the left hand. During work on my master thesis I hurt my right arm & wrist that much that I am since using the hands in a alternating manner: every other day I will use the same mouse. I am a right-handed person, but there really was no big adaption period in order to use a left-hand mouse. Sure, you are less precise with it and I would not recommend to play games with your secondary hand on the mouse but for everyday tasks, this schedule really helps me. On the MX Vertical, I do not like the surface material, as it seems prone to get scratched off easily (similar to genuine leather or synthetic leather on many other products) and you end up with small plastic/rubber pebbles all around the mouse. Concerning the Logitech Lift, I would like to see USB C support and an internal battery that you can charge.

## Microphone - Blue Yeti

The Blue Yeti. Due to this paper https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1075547018759345, I bought a professional microphone for my PhD defense in order to make sure that the audience' audio experience would not negatively impact my grade. Directly hearing the audio feedback is a nice feature of this microphone. I am happy that I bought it. The only thing that could improve the product in my opinion: add a visual gain feedback (display or an led array) such that one is able to fine tune the gain on his own and recognize when clamping occurs without getting comments from the audience.

## Headset - Bose QuietComfort 35 II

The Bose QuietComfort 35 II. Its important to me that I can use my headset via cable or via bluetooth. Most of the time I use it via cable. I have not done any objective experiment on this but I have the impression that I can perceive the latency that bluetooth adds. Sometimes, conversations in Teams calls feel very unnatural as the bluetooth devices of the participants add __friction__ so to say. And everyone who has experienced it as well can attest that there are only few things that feel worse than input lag. And that is exactly it: input lag.
